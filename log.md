# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Qui Nov  2 21:27:38 BRST 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created functions in Emacs Lisp to activate linum and
  column-number modes for source code files only.

**Thoughts**: I'm learning Elisp without even realizing it! :O

**Link to work**: [init.el](https://github.com/Auralcat/my-dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/init.el)

### Day 1: Sex Nov  3 23:18:55 BRST 2017

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do much today. There's this project I started last
  year in Python for catalogging the ratings of my music collection, which
  spans a couple hundred GBs. I was learning how to use the 'os' module at
  the time, now I'm considering changing it to Ruby.

**Thoughts**: Now I got more knowledge and I might be able to finish this.
  What I want is to generate a CSV file like so:

  "track_number", "track_title", "rating"

  File name will be the name of the folder the music files are in.
  Gotta crawl a lot of subdirectories and catalog everything.

### Day 2: SÃ¡b Nov  4 23:56:16 BRST 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the links in the repo, for some reason I couldn't
  get my folder to be recognized when I named it "scripts".

**Thoughts**: -

### Day 3: Dom Nov 5

**Today's Progress**: Outlined the roadmap for the script:
  - Read the ID3 tags of the mp3 files
  - Copy the POPM tag info into a CSV file in the "rating" field

  Also learned how to work with files and directories in Ruby.

**Challenges**:
  - Popularimeter tag isn't a standard
  - FLAC files don't hold ID3 tags
  - Not all the files have tags (or even correct ones)

**Thoughts**: I'm using id3info to get the tags from the files, Ruby actually
  works well for that by calling the command like `this`.  I found it easy to
  extract the info from the string as well, with map() and split(), but this can
  be done in Python too.

### Day 4: Seg Nov  6 20:14:41 BRST 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a detour from the main project and ended up porting
  the Fairyfloss color theme from @sailorhg to Emacs, after adjusting the
  version proposed by @IrIna.

**Thoughts**: (to be completed)
