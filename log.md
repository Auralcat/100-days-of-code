# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Qui Nov  2 21:27:38 BRST 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created functions in Emacs Lisp to activate linum and
  column-number modes for source code files only.

**Thoughts**: I'm learning Elisp without even realizing it! :O

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do much today. There's this project I started last
  year in Python for catalogging the ratings of my music collection, which
  spans a couple hundred GBs. I was learning how to use the 'os' module at
  the time, now I'm considering changing it to Ruby.

**Thoughts**: Now I got more knowledge and I might be able to finish this.
  What I want is to generate a CSV file like so:

  "track_number", "track_title", "rating"

  File name will be the name of the folder the music files are in.
  Gotta crawl a lot of subdirectories and catalog everything.
